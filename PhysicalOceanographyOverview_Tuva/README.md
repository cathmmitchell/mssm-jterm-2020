## Class Outline
1. Go through the presentation until the "Let's explore some data: station1" slide.
2. Open the Station 1 Tuva link and plot a temperature profile, colored by date (get the students to follow along with you)
3. Discuss (as a class) the questions on the next slide and talk about water column mixing
4. Let the students explore the other three Tuva datasets (Station 4, 20170912 and 20171109) using the guiding questions in the presentations. Students can work in pairs or small groups.
5. Discuss (as a class) their findings and go through the rest of the presentation

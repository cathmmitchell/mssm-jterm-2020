Intro contains all the relevant files for the first R class. We do a brief R intro, and plot a temperature profile from previous Colby data.

PlottingDockProfiles contains all the relevant files for the second R class, where we plotted the temperature profiles we recorded off the dock during the week. There are a few different versions of the scripts, but `readSondeFile.R` and `plotAllSondeData.R` are the two files that we ended up writing in class.

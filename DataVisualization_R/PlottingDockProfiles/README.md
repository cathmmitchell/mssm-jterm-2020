# Teaching notes

## Class outline
1. Go to Google Drive / Computing in Oceanography / Data / and download the three files that are named "BLOS_MSSM_jterm_YYYYMMDD.csv" into the folder we created yesterday on our desktops
2. Open RStudio
3. Set the working directory to our folder
4. Today we are going to work in scripts i.e. save our commands so they can be run again. First script we are going to create is `readSondeData.R`. Do live coding and go through `readSondeData.R` line-by-line until everyone has successfully plotted the first profile. Make sure everyone saves the script!
5. Get the students to edit their code to run `readSondeData.R` for the other days you have temperature data for.
6. (If extra time, do `readSondeDataAll-forLoop.R`)
7. To do an easier comparison of the different temperature profiles, plot them all on one graph i.e. live code through `plotAllSondeData.R`
8. Discuss the differences in the temperature profiles for each day.
